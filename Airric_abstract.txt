Our main aim of this project was to comprehensively access three different learning models in order to comparatively analyze their significance. The three models we opted for are: Multi-layer Perceptron using Keras framework, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor and Support Vector Regressor using SKlearn framework. Finally, we validate them using a 5-fold cross-validation and test all of them on the same dataset to assess their performance.
